<summary>Modules in Go language</summary>
Go code is grouped into packages, and packages are grouped into modules. Your module specifies dependencies needed to run your code, including the Go version and the set of other modules it requires.
In a module, you collect one or more related packages for a discrete and useful set of functions. For example, you might create a module with packages that have functions for doing financial analysis so that others writing financial applications can use your work.

<summary>First step before running any go code (even if it is Hello World) - Create a Module</summary>
1. Target code must belong to a module.
  To create a module you need to run the mod init command
  
  example:
    
  ```
  go mod init module_path
  ```
  _**module_path:**_

  If you publish a module, this must be a path from which your module can be downloaded by Go tools. That would be your code's repository.

  * The go mod init command creates a go.mod file to track your code's dependencies.

<summary>Package</summary>
A package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory. for example: fmt is a package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go.

Example:

```
package main // declaration of a package

import "fmt" // Importing an external package

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Writing and executing first go program</summary>
Create a file hello.go file and paste below example code into hello.go file.

Example:

```
package main // declaration of a package

import "fmt" // Importing an external package

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

In this code, you:

- _Declare a main package (a package is a way to group functions, and it's made up of all the files in the same directory)._
- _Import the popular fmt package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console. This package is one of the standard library packages you got when you installed Go._
- _Implement a main function to print a message to the console. A main function executes by default when you run the main package._
- 

**Run your code and see the greeting message:**
```
go run .
```
or
```
go run hello.go
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

<summary>Call code in the external package</summary>
To create a package, we just need to declare the package name as the first statement of the file:

```
package main // declaration of a package
```
To call a method from another package in Go, you need to follow a few steps:

1. **Import the Package**: First, you need to import the package containing the method you want to call. You do this by including an import statement at the top of your Go source file.

2. **Use the Method**: Once the package is imported, you can access the method by prefixing it with the package name.

Here's a simple example to illustrate these steps:

Suppose you have a package named `utils` with a method called `PrintMessage()` defined in a file named `utils.go`:

```go
// utils.go
package utils

import "fmt"

func PrintMessage(message string) {
    fmt.Println(message)
}
```

Now, in another file, let's say `main.go`, you want to call the `PrintMessage()` method from the `utils` package:

```go
// main.go
package main

import "your-package-path/utils" // import the package

func main() {
    // Call the method from the utils package
    utils.PrintMessage("Hello, World!")
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your-package-path/utils"` with the correct import path to your `utils` package.

By importing the `utils` package and prefixing the method with the package name (`utils.PrintMessage()`), you can call the `PrintMessage()` method from the `utils` package in your `main` function.

  <summary>Importance of main package in a go module</summary>
  
  - In Go, the main package holds the entry point to your application. When you build a Go program, you compile it into an executable binary. This binary must contain a package called "main" with a special function called "main()". This function serves as the entry point of your program, meaning it's the first function executed when you run your compiled program.
  
  - The main package is crucial because it defines where the execution of your program begins. Without it, the Go compiler wouldn't know where to start executing your code. It's the backbone of any executable Go program.
  
  - Additionally, when you're working with Go modules, the main package often serves as a reference point for module dependencies. Other packages within your module might depend on functionality provided by the main package, or they might be dependencies of the main package itself. This hierarchical structure helps organize and manage the dependencies of your Go project.

  <summary>Pointing your module to use other module dependencies from local machine</summary>
  
  - For production use, youâ€™d publish the example.com/greetings module from its repository (with a module path that reflected its published location), where Go tools could find it to download it. For now, because you haven't published the module yet, you need to adapt the example.com/hello module so it can find the example.com/greetings code on your local file system.
  - To do that, use the go mod edit command to edit the example.com/hello module to redirect Go tools from its module path (where the module isn't) to the local directory (where it is).

  Example:
      
        ```
        
        <home>/
         |-- greetings/
         |-- hello/
        
        ```
  
  Consider above two as modules you have.
    
      ```
  
        go mod edit -replace example.com/greetings=../greetings
        
    ```
  
  * We are saying that instead of downloding the greetings module from any repository, pick it from greetings directory which is parallel to hello directory (we are editing the go.mod of hello module)
  * The command specifies that example.com/greetings should be replaced with ../greetings for the purpose of locating the dependency. After you run the command, the go.mod file in the hello directory should include a replace directive as below:
    ```
    module example.com/hello

    go 1.16
    
    replace example.com/greetings => ../greetings
    ```

- From the command prompt in the hello directory, run the go mod tidy command to synchronize the example.com/hello module's dependencies, adding those required by the code, but not yet tracked in the module.
    ```
    go mod tidy
    ```

  * After the command completes, the example.com/hello module's go.mod file should look like this:
    ```
    module example.com/hello

    go 1.16
    
    replace example.com/greetings => ../greetings
    
    require example.com/greetings v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000

     ```
    * The command found the local code in the greetings directory, then added a require directive to specify that example.com/hello requires example.com/greetings. You created this dependency when you imported the greetings package in hello.go.
    * The number following the module path is a pseudo-version number -- a generated number used in place of a semantic version number (which the module doesn't have yet).

- To **reference a published module**, a go.mod file would typically omit the replace directive and use a require directive with a tagged version number at the end.
    ```
    require example.com/greetings v1.1.0
    ```
